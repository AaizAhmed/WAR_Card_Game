Project Details:

OS Used: 	   Windows 7/10
System Type:   64-bit Operating System

Language Used: Java
Compiler/Running environment: Java Development Kit (JDK) is required on the machine in which you
	want to run the program. Java Runtime Environment (JRE) should be fine to run the program as
	well.

Download Java SDK for your architecture using the following URL: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Build/Run: I used Eclipse IDE for this project. Inside eclipse create a new java project
		   and put all the .java files in one package and call it "proj2". Project2.java contains main(), run it 
		   and the game should start.

Files initially provided:
1) Project2.java
2) Suit.java
3) Rank.java

Files written by me:
1) Card.java
2) Deck.java
3) CardPile.java
4) Player.java
5) Game.java

Comments: If a WAR breaks out when players don't have enough cards, a message is displayed and the game results are 
		  printed. During a WAR the 4th cards can again cause a WAR to start, this cycle will continue until a 
		  winner is decided or players run out of cards. The score of such back to back WARS will be compounded and will
		  be added to the score of the player who ultimately wins the WAR.
